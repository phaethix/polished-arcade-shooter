# Sky Blaster — Architecture Guide

This document describes how the `src/` tree is organized after the v0.7.x architecture split. For product context, see [WHITEPAPER.md](./WHITEPAPER.md).

## Layered layout

```text

└── game/
    ├── engine.ts           Game loop orchestrator (update, collisions, state machine)

    ├── modes.ts            Per-mode wave rules and daily modifiers

    └── audio.ts            Synthesized sound effects
```

## Dependency rules

1. **`engine.ts` is the hub** — it imports domain modules and render helpers; domain modules must not import `engine.ts`.
2. **Render modules are pure drawing** — they receive `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and read-only game state; they do not mutate `GameData` or advance simulation.
3. **`app/` is outside the game domain** — input collection lives next to `App.tsx` so the game package stays testable without React.
4. **Data modules stay side-effect free** — `aircraft.ts`, `weapons.ts`, `chapters.ts`, and `modes.ts` export config and pure helpers only.

## Runtime flow

```text
App.tsx (RAF)
  ├─ inputRef  ← keyboard / pointer handlers
  ├─ update() or updateBackground()  ← engine.ts
  └─ render()  ← engine.ts
        ├─ chapters / hazards / enemies (domain draw)
        └─ render/* (UI and overlays)
```

`GameData` is a single mutable struct passed through update and render. Mode-specific behavior is resolved at runtime via `gameMode` and helpers in `modes.ts`.

## What still lives in `engine.ts`

The orchestrator intentionally retains:

- State machine transitions (`menu` → `playing` → `paused` / `gameover`)
- Wave spawning and collision resolution
- Power-up pickup, combo/graze scoring, achievement triggers
- Menu selection cycling and unlock actions

Future splits (only if `engine.ts` grows again): dedicated `collision-system.ts`, `wave-spawner.ts`, or `menu-actions.ts`.

## Known tech debt

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `engine.ts` size | Reduced from ~1350 lines; still the largest file because collisions and wave logic remain centralized. |
| Enemy rendering in `enemies.ts` | Enemy sprites stay with spawn/AI; only player-side world drawing moved to `render/world.ts`. |
| No automated tests | Manual play-testing and `npm run typecheck` / `npm run build` are the current gates. |
